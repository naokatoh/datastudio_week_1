# datastudio_week_1

Here is my Week one's project!
I used some datesets from NOAA and Canada's trading databases.
'''uchin_landing_us.ipynb
''' is the competed project.
'''urchin_price''' is my attempt to scrape [this page](https://marinespecies.wildlife.ca.gov/red-sea-urchin/the-fishery/) but I didn't use it in the end.
